# S&P 500 Stock Predictor

This project is the first machine learning program I created using neural networks and Facebook Prophet to predict the prices of stocks in the S&P 500 index.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the prices of S&P 500 stocks.
- **Technologies Used:** Neural Networks, FB Prophet.

## Features

- **Data Processing:**
  - Collects historical stock price data.
  - Preprocesses the data for use in machine learning models.

- **Prediction Models:**
  - Utilizes neural networks for complex pattern recognition.
  - Employs FB Prophet for time-series forecasting.

- **Results Visualization:**
  - Visualizes predicted stock prices against actual prices for better insights.


## Learning Outcomes

- Gained expertise in working with time-series data.
- Gained experience with neural networks for stock price prediction.
- Learned to use FB Prophet for time-series forecasting.
- Developed skills in data preprocessing and results visualization.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the prediction accuracy by experimenting with different model architectures and parameters.
- Integrate additional features such as sentiment analysis of financial news.
- Implement a web interface for user-friendly interaction with the prediction models.
